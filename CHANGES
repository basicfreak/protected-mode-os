Previous Updates:
	2014-06-27:
		(Repo Fix Sory Guys I had to Delete everything off the repo I messed up ;) RapidSVN is new to me)
		Moved to a cross compiler (gcc)
		Created Make File
		Removed over a thousand warning DJGPP was not reporting
		Changed to ELF32-i386 executable format
		Fixed i8042
		Fixed UART (COMS now act as Keyboard Buffer)
		Switched to Grub 0.92 (temporary)
		Added a whole bunch of debug info
		Broke FDC Driver
			Thus forcing removal of FAT12 Driver
				Thus we cannot load user land binarys

	2014-06-30:
		Fixed FDC Driver, now it is stable and a decent speed 2.8KB/s on real H/W
		FAT12 is back up
		You can load a user land application (binary)
			but it will crash the kernel if you do anything after loading

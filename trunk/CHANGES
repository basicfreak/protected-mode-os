	Fixed FDC Driver, now it is stable and a decent speed 2.8KB/s on real H/W
	FAT12 is back up
	You can load a user land application (binary)
		but it will crash the kernel if you do anything after loading

Next Update:
	Change code to load user land ELF32-i386 instead of binary
	Fix Task Switching and Locate any other bugs in the code...
	ADD PCI-IDE support (along with FAT32 and Ext2)
